# 10mhz_distributor
**Work in progress**
A 10 Mhz 3 channel distribution amplifier and low pass filter integrated in a BG8TBL GPSDO.

*This text will be italic*

**Notes worth reading**

1. Schematic and BOM show The Qorvo TQP369182 as the amp. TQP369180 was the amp actually used on the first board. The extra gain of the 182 seems unnecessary and I suspect the extra gain may cause oscillation. Upgrade at your own risk and let me know how it goes if you try.
