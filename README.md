# 10mhz_distributor
A 10 MHz 3 channel distribution amplifier and low pass filter designed to integrate in a BG7TBL GPSDO. A 5th. order LPF on both the input and outputs allows the input to be either sine or square and produce a sine output of around 10 dBm.
Power consumption is about 130 mA @12V.

**Notes worth reading**

1. Schematic and BOM show The Qorvo TQP369182 as the amp. TQP369180 was the amp actually used on the first board. The extra gain of the 182 seems unnecessary when driven with a 5V square wave and I suspect it may cause oscillation. Bias resistors remain at 91Î©. Upgrade at your own risk and let me know how it goes if you try.
1. Pads for a optional attn. are on the input. Untested.
1. Pads for a optional isolation transformer are on the 3rd. output. Untested.
1. Jitter and delay are untested, but assumed good enough for a inexpensive GPSDO. If you build it and have the lab to test please share your results.
1. I left the input BNC (J3) off of mine and ran a internal wire to the GPSDO output. The BNC could be added by those that want the option to loop the clock or any other suitable input back into the distribution amp. Or those that want to use this as a stand alone general purpose amp.
